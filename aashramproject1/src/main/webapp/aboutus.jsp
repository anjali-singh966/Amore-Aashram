        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Amor Aashram</span> is a compassionate initiative dedicated 
            to providing <strong>affordable, accessible, and senior-friendly</strong> 
            accommodations for elderly travelers (60+) exploring Bihar. Many senior citizens wish 
            to travel but often face challenges in finding budget-friendly and suitable places 
            to stay. Traditional hotels can be expensive and lack the peaceful, supportive 
            environment they need. Amor Aashram bridges this gap by offering well-facilitated ashrams 
            in key tourist locations across Bihar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our ashrams are located in some of Bihar most renowned tourist destinations, including 
            <span class="highlight">Bodh Gaya, Nalanda, Rajgir, Vaishali, Patna, Madhubani, Kesaria, 
            and Sitamarhi</span>. These locations provide not only historical and cultural richness 
            but also a serene and comfortable atmosphere for elderly visitors. Each ashram is equipped 
            with essential amenities such as <strong>medical support, nutritious meals, recreational 
            activities, and a tranquil environment</strong> to ensure a comfortable stay.
        </p>
        <p>
            The platform is designed with a <span class="highlight">bilingual interface 
            (Hindi & English)</span>, making it easy for elderly users to navigate and book 
            accommodations effortlessly. Our mission is to enable senior citizens to 
            <strong>travel with dignity, comfort, and ease</strong>, allowing them to 
            experience Bihar’s heritage without financial or accessibility concerns. Amor Aashram is
            more than just a stay; it’s a <span class="highlight">home away from home</span>, 
            ensuring every elderly traveler finds warmth, care, and companionship during their
            journey.
